# Business process
The typical flow of a patient being transported by ambulance to an emergency department (ED) involves multiple stages of care and prioritization. Here's how the process usually works:

1. Ambulance Arrival at the Hospital (Ramping)

When the ambulance arrives at the hospital, it is often met by a hospital staff member. However, if the ED is at capacity or understaffed, the patient may be held in the ambulance (this is referred to as "ramping"). The ambulance paramedics continue to monitor and care for the patient until the hospital can accept them.


2. Transfer to the Emergency Department (ED)

Once there is capacity, the patient is transferred from the ambulance into the ED. The paramedics hand over the patient to the ED staff, typically providing a detailed report on the patient's condition, history, and treatment already administered.

3. Triage

After the handover, the patient is taken to the triage nurse, where they are assessed based on the urgency of their condition. This is often done using a scale, such as the Australasian Triage Scale (ATS), ranging from 1 (immediate care needed) to 5 (less urgent).
    During triage, the nurse checks vital signs and asks questions about the patient's symptoms to determine the severity of the case.

4. Initial Treatment / Waiting Room

After triage, the patient may either:
Be taken directly to a treatment area if their condition is urgent, or
Wait in the waiting room if their condition is not life-threatening. In some cases, the patient may be monitored in the ambulance until space becomes available.

5. Doctor/Nurse Practitioner Assessment

Once the patient is seen by a doctor or nurse practitioner, they undergo a more thorough assessment, including diagnostic tests like bloodwork, imaging (X-rays, CT scans), or physical examinations.
At this stage, the ED team will decide on the course of treatment based on the patient's symptoms and test results.

6. Ongoing Care or Discharge

The patient will either:
Be treated and discharged if their condition can be managed with immediate care, or
Be admitted to the hospital for further treatment if their condition requires longer-term care.

7.  Handover to Ward/ICU (If Admitted)

If admitted, the patient is transferred to a hospital ward, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), or another appropriate unit, depending on their condition. The handover from the ED team to the ward's medical team is critical for continuity of care.
This process may vary slightly depending on the hospital's protocols and the severity of the patient's condition. Ambulance "ramping" can be a critical bottleneck if the ED is overwhelmed, delaying care and tying up emergency medical resources.
